/* The sequence of Fibonacci numbers has the formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. 
In other words, the next number is a sum of the two preceding ones.
First two numbers are 1, then 2(1+1), then 3(1+2), 5(2+3) and so on: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21....
Fibonacci numbers are related to the Golden ratio and many natural phenomena around us.
Write a function fib(n) that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.*/
function fib(n){
    return n <= 1 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
console.log(fib(3)); // 2
console.log(fib(7)); // 13
console.log(fib(77)); // 5527939700884757
